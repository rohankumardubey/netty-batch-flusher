[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spotify/netty-batch-flusher.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spotify/netty-batch-flusher)

A batcher of netty channel flushes for gathering writes into fewer syscalls.

## Usage

Replace calls to `Channel.flush()` and `ChannelHandlerContext.flush()` with calls to `BatchFlusher.flush()`.
`BatchFlusher` will then gather multiple flushes into fewer calls to `Channel.flush()`.

At that point the actual gathering write can be left to Netty to perform using the underlying `GatheringByteChannel`.
Alternatively the `write()` and `flush()` methods of `ChannelOutboundHandler` can be implemented to perform custom e.g.
`ByteBuf` consolidation.
